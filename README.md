Client-server application for backup and versioning.

It allows users to monitor a specific folder in their file system and load them into a server to be able to:

- Syncronize it with another folder / machine
- Keep track of the different version of the files
- Restore a single file to a previuos version or the all folder to a previuos snapshot
